# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

A local, end-to-end DevSecOps demonstration project using Jenkins, Docker, Trivy, and Minikube Kubernetes—all running on your own machine.  
The pipeline builds, scans, and deploys a sample Java Spring Boot application with secure automation and best practices.

## 🚧 Project Status

> **This project is a work in progress.**
> 
> Core features—CI/CD pipeline, Trivy security scanning, Docker Hub integration, and unit test reporting—are fully functional.
> 
> **Coming soon:**
> - 🚀 Deployment to Minikube Kubernetes cluster
> - 🔍 SonarQube static code analysis integration
> - 🛡️ OWASP ZAP dynamic security scans (DAST)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Jenkins** (running on Docker)
- **Custom Jenkins Docker Agent** (Java 21, Maven, Docker CLI, Trivy, Kubectl)
- **Docker** (containerization and registry push)
- **Trivy** (static analysis and container vulnerability scanning)
- **JUnit** (unit testing results archived in Jenkins)
- **Minikube** (local Kubernetes cluster for deployment — WIP)
- **SonarQube** (for SAST — WIP)
- **OWASP ZAP** (for DAST — WIP)

## 📖 About This Project

This project simulates a real-world DevSecOps pipeline, intended to showcase secure CI/CD practices.  
It demonstrates how to integrate security scanning at every phase of software delivery, using open-source tools, fully automated through Jenkins.

It is designed for educational purposes and as a portfolio project to highlight practical DevOps and security automation skills.

Future enhancements will focus on improving security validation, code quality monitoring, and container orchestration best practices.
